## Introduction
X Clone is one of the four and the last project included in [Sahand Gavidel's](https://www.sahandghavidel.com/) Next.js [beginner-friendly course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-js-tutorial/). The course includes step-by-step instructions for building this and other 3 clone projects, with one of them replicating the X (former Twitter) interface. Users can create, like, reply and delete posts of their own. It's also possible to add images to a post.

## Development
### Stack and Language Decision
Moreover, while Sahand instructs the project using JavaScript, I've chose deliberately to implement it using TypeScript. This decision not only eases the development process with enhanced type safety, but also aligns with the rising trend and widespread adoption of TypeScript in the developer community.
### Styles and Icons
To style the project, it was employed [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), a CSS framework which provides classes to style HTML elements, contributing to a more efficient development process. \
Additionally, for the integration of icons, [**Phosphor Icons**](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) was employed—an extensive library featuring a diverse collection of icons to enhance the overall user experience.
